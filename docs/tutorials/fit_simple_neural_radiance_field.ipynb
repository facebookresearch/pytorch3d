    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to fit Neural Radiance Field given a set of views of a scene using differentiable implicit function rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this tutorial will explain how to:\n",
    "1. Create a differentiable implicit function renderer with either image-grid or Monte Carlo ray sampling.\n",
    "2. Create an Implicit model of a scene.\n",
    "3. Fit the implicit function (Neural Radiance Field) based on input images using the differentiable implicit renderer. \n",
    "4. Visualize the learnt implicit function.\n",

    "\n",
    "The simplifications include:\n",
    "* *Ray sampling*: This notebook does not perform stratified ray sampling but rather ray sampling at equidistant depths.\n",
    "* *Rendering*: We do a single rendering pass, as opposed to the original implementation that does a coarse and fine rendering pass.\n",
    "* *Architecture*: Our network is shallower which allows for faster optimization possibly at the cost of surface details.\n",
    "* *Mask loss*: Since our observations include segmentation masks, we also optimize a silhouette loss that forces rays to either get fully absorbed inside the volume, or to completely pass through it.\n"

The harmonic embeddings then enter the _color_ and _opacity_ branches of the NeRF model in order to label each ray point with a 3D vector and a 1D scalar ranging in [0-1] which define the point's RGB color and opacity respectively.\n",
