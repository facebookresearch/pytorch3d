# Why PyTorch3D


Our goal with PyTorch3D is to help accelerate research at the intersection of deep learning and 3D. 3D data is more complex than 2D images and while working on projects such as [Mesh R-CNN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/meshrcnn) and [C3DPO](https://github.com/facebookresearch/c3dpo_nrsfm), we encountered several challenges including 3D data representation, batching, and speed. We have developed many useful operators and abstractions for working on 3D deep learning and want to share this with the community to drive novel research in this area. 

In PyTorch3D we have included efficient 3D operators, heterogeneous batching capabilities, and a modular differentiable rendering API, to equip researchers in this field with a much needed toolkit to implement cutting-edge research with complex 3D inputs.
