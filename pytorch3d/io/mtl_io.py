    r"""
    Given a single texture image and the uv coordinates for all the
    face vertices, create a square texture map per face using
    the formulation from [1].

    For a triangle with vertices (v0, v1, v2) we can create a barycentric coordinate system
    with the x axis being the vector (v0 - v2) and the y axis being the vector (v1 - v2).
    The barycentric coordinates range from [0, 1] in the +x and +y direction so this creates
    a triangular texture space with vertices at (0, 1), (0, 0) and (1, 0).

    The per face texture map is of shape (texture_size, texture_size, 3)
    which is a square. To map a triangular texture to a square grid, each
    triangle is parametrized as follows (e.g. R = texture_size = 3):

    The triangle texture is first divided into RxR = 9 subtriangles which each
    map to one grid cell. The numbers in the grid cells and triangles show the mapping.

    ..code-block::python

        Square per face texture map:

                |  6   |  7   |  8   |
                |______|______|______|
                |      |      |      |

                |______|______|______|
               0                      R


    The barycentric coordinates of each grid cell are calculated using the
    xy coordinates:

    ..code-block::python

            The cartesian coordinates are:

            Grid 1:

               R ____________________
                |      |      |      |
                |  20  |  21  |  22  |
                |______|______|______|
                |      |      |      |
                |  10  |  11  |  12  |
                |______|______|______|
                |      |      |      |
                |  00  |  01  |  02  |
                |______|______|______|
               0                      R

            where 02 means y = 0, x = 2

        Now consider this subset of the triangle which corresponds to
        grid cells 0 and 8:

        ..code-block::python

            1/R  ________
                |\    8  |
                |  \     |
                | 0   \  |
                |_______\|
               0          1/R

        The centroids of the triangles are:
            0: (1/3, 1/3) * 1/R
            8: (2/3, 2/3) * 1/R

    For each grid cell we can now calculate the centroid `(c_y, c_x)`
    of the corresponding texture triangle:
        - if `(x + y) < R`, then offset the centroid of
            triangle 0 by `(y, x) * (1/R)`
        - if `(x + y) > R`, then offset the centroid of
            triangle 8 by `((R-1-y), (R-1-x)) * (1/R)`.

    This is equivalent to updating the portion of Grid 1
    above the diagonal, replacing `(y, x)` with `((R-1-y), (R-1-x))`:

    ..code-block::python

              R _____________________
                |      |      |      |
                |  20  |  01  |  00  |
                |______|______|______|
                |      |      |      |
                |  10  |  11  |  10  |
                |______|______|______|
                |      |      |      |
                |  00  |  01  |  02  |
                |______|______|______|
               0                      R

    The barycentric coordinates (w0, w1, w2) are then given by:

    ..code-block::python

        w0 = c_x
        w1 = c_y
        w2 = 1- w0 - w1

    Args:
        image: FloatTensor of shape (H, W, 3)
        faces_verts_uvs: uv coordinates for each vertex in each face  (F, 3, 2)
        texture_size: int

    Returns:
        atlas: a FloatTensor of shape (F, texture_size, texture_size, 3) giving a
            per face texture map.
