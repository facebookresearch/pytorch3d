    """
    Executes the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm [1, 2] in order to find
    a similarity transformation (rotation `R`, translation `T`, and
    optionally scale `s`) between two given differently-sized sets of
    `d`-dimensional points `X` and `Y`, such that:

    `s[i] X[i] R[i] + T[i] = Y[NN[i]]`,

    for all batch indices `i` in the least squares sense. Here, Y[NN[i]] stands
    for the indices of nearest neighbors from `Y` to each point in `X`.
    Note, however, that the solution is only a local optimum.

    Args:
        **X**: Batch of `d`-dimensional points
            of shape `(minibatch, num_points_X, d)` or a `Pointclouds` object.
        **Y**: Batch of `d`-dimensional points
            of shape `(minibatch, num_points_Y, d)` or a `Pointclouds` object.
        **init_transform**: A named-tuple `SimilarityTransform` of tensors
            `R`, `T, `s`, where `R` is a batch of orthonormal matrices of
            shape `(minibatch, d, d)`, `T` is a batch of translations
            of shape `(minibatch, d)` and `s` is a batch of scaling factors
            of shape `(minibatch,)`.
        **trim_fraction**: A float or 1d `Tensor` of shape `(minibatch,)` in [0, 1]
            specifying the ratio of outliers in each point cloud. If float, assume
            the same outliers ratio for all point clouds in the batch. Outliers will
            be detected by taking the `trim_fraction * num_points_X` highest values of 
            `s[i] X[i] R[i] + T[i] = Y[NN[i]]`.  
        **max_iterations**: The maximum number of ICP iterations.
        **relative_rmse_thr**: A threshold on the relative root mean squared error
            used to terminate the algorithm.
        **estimate_scale**: If `True`, also estimates a scaling component `s`
            of the transformation. Otherwise assumes the identity
            scale and returns a tensor of ones.
        **allow_reflection**: If `True`, allows the algorithm to return `R`
            which is orthonormal but has determinant==-1.
        **verbose**: If `True`, prints status messages during each ICP iteration.

    Returns:
        A named tuple `ICPSolution` with the following fields:
        **converged**: A boolean flag denoting whether the algorithm converged
            successfully (=`True`) or not (=`False`).
        **rmse**: Attained root mean squared error after termination of ICP.
        **Xt**: The point cloud `X` transformed with the final transformation
            (`R`, `T`, `s`). If `X` is a `Pointclouds` object, returns an
            instance of `Pointclouds`, otherwise returns `torch.Tensor`.
        **RTs**: A named tuple `SimilarityTransform` containing
        a batch of similarity transforms with fields:
            **R**: Batch of orthonormal matrices of shape `(minibatch, d, d)`.
            **T**: Batch of translations of shape `(minibatch, d)`.
            **s**: batch of scaling factors of shape `(minibatch, )`.
        **t_history**: A list of named tuples `SimilarityTransform`
            the transformation parameters after each ICP iteration.
