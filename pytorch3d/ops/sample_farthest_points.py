    """
    Iterative farthest point sampling algorithm [1] to subsample a set of
    K points from a given pointcloud. At each iteration, a point is selected
    which has the largest nearest neighbor distance to any of the
    already selected points.

    Farthest point sampling provides more uniform coverage of the input
    point cloud compared to uniform random sampling.

    [1] Charles R. Qi et al, "PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning
        on Point Sets in a Metric Space", NeurIPS 2017.

    Args:
        points: (N, P, D) array containing the batch of pointclouds
        lengths: (N,) number of points in each pointcloud (to support heterogeneous
            batches of pointclouds)
        K: samples required in each sampled point cloud (this is typically << P). If
            K is an int then the same number of samples are selected for each
            pointcloud in the batch. If K is a tensor is should be length (N,)
            giving the number of samples to select for each element in the batch
        random_start_point: bool, if True, a random point is selected as the starting
            point for iterative sampling.

    Returns:
        selected_points: (N, K, D), array of selected values from points. If the input
            K is a tensor, then the shape will be (N, max(K), D), and padded with
            0.0 for batch elements where k_i < max(K).
        selected_indices: (N, K) array of selected indices. If the input
            K is a tensor, then the shape will be (N, max(K), D), and padded with
            -1 for batch elements where k_i < max(K).
